<p>
This plugin generates statistics, downloadable data files and interactive visualization of coverage over
targeted regions of the reference genome.
</p>
<p>
This plugin produces different report styles depending on the Application (Library Type) employed and in some cases,
such as those using DNA and RNA, these styles may be specific to indivdual barcodes. However, it is unsuitable for
applications where the reads are not mapped to a reference.
