This plugin generates statistics, down-loadable data files and interactive visualization of coverage over targeted regions of the reference genome.

It is fully compatible with run plans that specify barcode-specific references and/or target region files and produces reports that are customized to the application (library) selected.

Plan options may be re-specified for manual runs of the plugin and other application specific options are also available, e.g. for filtering reads and sample tracking
