DISCLAIMER: The Agilent Genomics NextGen Toolkit (AGeNT) module has been
designed to provide the adaptor trimming and duplicate read removal
capabilities in a flexible command-line interface for
integration into your bioinformatics pipeline. Agilent does not guarantee the
usability of third party tools (open- or closed-source) in
upstream/downstream analysis of data in conjunction with AGeNT. AGeNT is
explicitly designed and fine-tuned for customers with established in-house
bioinformatics experts with the capability to build, integrate, maintain, and
troubleshoot internal analysis pipelines. Moreover, the module is designed
specifically for customers with sufficient computing infrastructure and IT
support to troubleshoot all issues unrelated to the execution of the
AgeNT algorithms.
